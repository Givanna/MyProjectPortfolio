Here's some information for the developer of the template:
A big, modern, blocky affair with a mobile-style menu, fully responsive styling,
and an assortment of pre-styled elements.

Customization
On my index page I made several customizations. I kept the main background, however if you want to change the background first adjust the main.css file.
	- Add a section titled: . custom-background {
		max-width: 800px; /* Optional: adjust max-width as needed */
		margin: 0 auto; /* Center the content */
		padding: 20px; /* Optional: adjust padding as needed */
		background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.459); /* Optional: change inner background */
		border-radius: 10px; /* Optional: add rounded corners */
		box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.274); /* Optional: add a subtle shadow */
	}

	- In your main html file, add the class="custom-background"
	- You can also do this per section. 
		Ex. <!-- One -->
					<section id="one" class="custom-background">


Favicon
If you'd like to add a favicon, https://favicon.io/ will automatically generate the files you need. You can customize by color, font, size, logo, etc.
	- Once you have generated the favicon download the package files.
	- Add the image files to your root folder or main images folder.
	- Add the html code to the head of your main html file and change the link to direct to your images.
