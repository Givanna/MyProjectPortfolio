								<h2>About Me</h2>
								<p>In my role as a solutions engineer, I consistently encountered a significant gap between management and the engineering team. Regardless of their backgrounds, engineers universally voiced frustrations over unrealistic expectations and deadlines set by managers who lacked firsthand experience in their roles. Conversely, stakeholders often seemed disconnected from the challenges faced by the management team.</p>
								  
								<p>Recognizing this pervasive issue, I identified an opportunity to bridge these gaps between Stakeholders, Management, and Engineers. Driven by my passion for problem-solving, I embarked on a journey to enact meaningful change. I focused on improving communication, enhancing operational efficiency, and refining documentation practices to foster a more cohesive and productive environment for all involved.</p>

								<p>Now transitioning from Engineer to Project Manager, I am dedicated to leveraging my experiences to drive successful project outcomes. Join me on this journey as I apply my expertise to unite teams, streamline processes, and ensure project success.</p>
